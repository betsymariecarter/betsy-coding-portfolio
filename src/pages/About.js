            <h4>
              Degrees: Psychology (Bachelor of Arts), Painting/Drawing (Bachelor
              of Visual Arts)
            </h4>
            <p>
              As a lifelong artist with an interest in exploring the depths of the
              human condition, pursuing a double major in Psychology and
              Painting/Drawing was the best option for my specific interests.
              Juggling both majors and switching gears from creative to scientific
              studies was a fascinating challenge that taught me an important
              lesson in time management and self discipline.{" "}

              Grace Hopper Fullstack Academy Boot Camp - November 2022 - April
              2023

            <h4>Languages Learned: HTML, CSS, Javascript</h4>
            <h4>Libraries Learned: React, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Express </h4>
            <p>
              I have always wanted to learn how to make websites and games
              featuring my own artwork, so doing a coding bootcamp was a logical
              next step for me. Additionally, I wanted to make a shift
              professionally to a field that utilized my creative skills and love
              for problem-solving. I learned how to work collaboratively through
              agile-based methodology and how to manage my time.
